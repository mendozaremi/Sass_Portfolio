        <p> Hello, my name is Remi, I was born In the Dominican republic raised in the Bronx.
          In my prior work experience, I worked as an operations associate. Speaking on my creative side, I’m a part-time photographer/videographer where I create content for clients and tailor it to their specific needs. Capturing memories for other people is something I hold dear to my work and accomplishments. My curiousness to find a career where creating, building and technology are in the mix led me to consider the path of becoming a software engineer. My first introduction to Web development was at The Knowledge House a non-profit organization where I was exposed to programming and markup language. From The Knowledge House, I got accepted to Fullstack academy where I have been increasing my software engineering knowledge every day. With my new-found knowledge, I hope to work for a company deeply rooted in technology that can help a person’s wellness on a daily basis.
